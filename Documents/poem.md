# Whispers of the Wind

The wind whispers secrets through the trees,  
A dance of shadows, a breath of ease.  
It carries stories, both old and new,  
Of dreams unspoken, of skies so blue.

In its song, the world takes flight,  
Carried away in the quiet of night.  
A fleeting moment, soft and clear,  
A reminder that hope is always near.
